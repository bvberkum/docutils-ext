        h2. Text Effects
        
        Text effects are used to change the formatting of words and sentences.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        | *strong* | Makes text *strong*. |
        | _emphasis_ | Makes text _emphasis_. |
        | ??citation?? | Makes text in ??citation??. |
        | -strikethrough- | Makes text as -strikethrough-. |
        | +underlined+ | Makes text as +underlined+. |
        | ^superscript^ | Makes text in ^superscript^. |
        | ~subscript~ | Makes text in ~subscript~. |
        | {{text will be monospaced}} |  Makes text as {{code text}}. |
        | bq. Some block quoted text | To make an entire paragraph into a block quotation, place "bq. " before it. |
        
        Example:
        
        bq. Some block quoted text
        
        {quote}
        \{quote}
        here is quoteble
        content to be quoted
        {quote}{quote}   
        
        Quote a block of text that's longer than one paragraph.
        Example:
        
        {quote}
        here is quoteble
        content to be quoted
        {quote}   
        
        {color:red}
        look ma, red text!
        {color}   
        
        Changes the color of a block of text.
        
        h2. Text Breaks
        
        Most of the time, explicit paragraph breaks are not required - Confluence will be able to paginate your paragraphs properly.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        (empty line)  Produces a new paragraph
        \\  Creates a line break. Not often needed, most of the time Confluence will guess new lines for you appropriately.
        ----  Creates a horizontal rule
        ---   Produces — symbol.
        --  Produces – symbol.
        
        h2.  Links
        
        Links are the heart of Confluence, so learning how to create them quickly is important.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        [#anchor]
        [^attachment.ext]
        or
        [pagetitle]
        [pagetitle#anchor]
        [pagetitle^attachment.ext]
        or
        [spacekey:pagetitle]
        [spacekey:pagetitle#anchor]
        [spacekey:pagetitle^attachment.ext]   Creates an internal hyperlink to the specified page in the desired space (or the current one if you don't specify any space). Appending the optional '#' sign followed by an anchor name will lead into a specific bookmarked point of the desired page. Also having the optional '^' followed by the name of an attachment will lead into a link to the attachment of the desired page.
        
        Example: pagetitle
        
        If such a page doesn't already exist, it will allow you to create the page in the current space. Create page links will have a [Create new page: anewpage] after them.
        
        Example: anewpage [Create new page: anewpage]
        [link alias|#anchor|link tip]
        [link alias|^attachment.ext|link tip]
        or
        [link alias|pagetitle|link tip]
        [link alias|pagetitle#anchor|link tip]
        [link alias|pagetitle^attachment.ext|link tip]
        or
        [link alias|spacekey:pagetitle|link tip]
        [link alias|spacekey:pagetitle#anchor|link tip]
        [link alias|spacekey:pagetitle^attachment.ext|link tip]   Creates an internal hyperlink to the specified page in the desired space (or the current one if you don't specify any space) where the link text is different from the actual hyperlink link. Also you can have an optional link tip which will appear as tooltip. Appending the optional '#' sign followed by an anchor name will lead into a specific bookmarked point of the desired page. Also having the optional '^' followed by the name of an attachment will lead into a link to the attachment of the desired page.
        
        Example: link alias
        [/2004/01/12/Blog Post] [spacekey:/2004/01/12/Blog Post]  Creates an internal hyperlink to the specified blog post in the desired space (or the current one if you don't specify any space). You must specify the date the post was made in /year/month/day form as shown. Anchors and link text can be added the same way as described above.
        
        If you attempt to link to a blog post that doesn't exist, no link will be created.
        
        Example:
        
            /2004/01/12/Blog Post
            my link name
        
        [/2004/01/12]
        [spacekey:/2004/01/12]
        or
        [my link name|/2004/01/12]
        [my link name|spacekey:/2004/01/12]   Creates an internal hyperlink to a view of a whole day's blog. Specify the date you wish to link to as year/month/day. Link titles can be supplied as with other links. It is possible to link to days with no blog posts on them: the destination page will just be empty.
        
        Examples:
        
            /2004/01/12/Blog Post
            my link name
        
        [$12345]
        or
        [my link name|$12345]   Creates a link to a piece of content by its internal database ID. This is currently the only way to link to a mail message.
        
        Examples:
        
            Re: Webwork 2 Upgrade
            my link name
        
        [spacekey:]
        [custom link title|spacekey:]
          Creates a link to the space homepage, or space summary page of a particular space. Which of these the link points to depends on the configuration of the space being linked to. If the space does not exist, the link will be drawn with a strike-through to indicate it is an invalid space.
        
        Examples:
        
            spacekey
            custom link title
            [nosuchspace:]
        
        [~username]
        [custom link title|~username]
          Creates a link to the user profile page of a particular user. By default, will be drawn with a user icon and the user's full name, but if you supply a custom link text, the icon will not be drawn. If the user being linked to does not exist, the link will be drawn with a strike-through.
        
        Examples:
        
            User Full Name
            custom link title
            [~nosuchuser]
        
        [phrase@shortcut]
        [custom link text|phrase@shortcut]  Creates a shortcut link to the specified shortcut site. Shortcuts are configured by the site administrator. You can add a link title to shortcuts in the same manner as other links.
        
        Examples:
        
            confluence@Google
            custom link text
        
        [http://confluence.atlassian.com]
        [Atlassian|http://atlassian.com]  Creates a link to an external resource, special characters that come after the URL and are not part of it must be separated with a space. External links are denoted with an arrow icon.
        
        Note: the [] around external links are optional in the case you do not want to use any alias for the link.
        
        Examples:
        
            http://confluence.atlassian.com>>
            Atlassian>> 
        
        [mailto:legendaryservice@atlassian.com]   Creates a link to an email address, complete with mail icon.
        
        Example: >>legendaryservice@atlassian.com
        [file://c:/temp/foo.txt]
        [file://z:/file/on/network/share.txt]   
        
        This only works on Internet Explorer
        Creates a link to file on your computer or on a network share that you have mapped to a drive
        {doc:/display/DOC/Confluence+Documentation+Home}Confluence Documentation{doc}   
        
        A macro that allows you to quickly create links to content at http://confluence.atlassian.com.
        
            Default parameter — The link to the content relative to http://confluence.atlassian.com.
            Macro body — The link text, interpreted as wiki markup.
        
        {anchor:anchorname}   Creates a bookmark anchor inside the page. You can then create links directly to that anchor. So the link [My Page#here] will link to wherever in "My Page" there is an {anchor:here} macro, and the link [#there] will link to wherever in the current page there is an {anchor:there} macro.
        
        h2.  Lists
        
        Lists allow you to present information as a series of ordered items.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        * some
        * bullet
        ** indented
        ** bullets
        * points  A bulleted list (must be in first column). Use more (**) for deeper indentations.
        
        Example:
        
            some
            bullet
                indented
                bullets
            points
        
        - different
        - bullet
        - types   A list item (with -), several lines create a single list.
        
        Example:
        
            different
            bullet
            types
        
        # a
        # numbered
        # list  A numbered list (must be in first column). Use more (##, ###) for deeper indentations.
        
        Example:
        
            a
            numbered
            list
        
        # a
        # numbered
        #* with
        #* nested
        #* bullet
        # list
        
        * a
        * bulletted
        *# with
        *# nested
        *# numbered
        * list
          You can even go with any kind of mixed nested lists:
        
        Example:
        
            a
            numbered
                with
                nested
                bullet
            list
        
        
            a
            bulletted
                with
                nested
                numbered
            list
        
        {dynamictasklist:thingsToDo}
        {dynamictasklist:thingsToDo|showAssignee=false}
        {dynamictasklist:thingsToDo|promptOnDelete=false}   
        
        The Dynamic Tasklist Macro displays a task list which can be modified in the page as it is viewed. Despite the fact that this plugin has an ajax UI, it is still fully versioned like a normal Confluence page.
        
            showAssignee - (optional) If set to true the assignee will be shown in the tasks.
            width - (optional) The width of the tasklist (default is 640px). To set the width to 400 pixels, set the parameter value to 400px.
            enableLocking - (optional) If set to true, tasks can be locked so other users can not modify.
            autoLockOnComplete (optional) Used in conjunction with enableLocking. Tasks will auto lock when it is completed.
            promptOnDelete - (optional) If set to false there will not be any confirmation prompt when deleting a task.
        
        Example:
        What you need to type   What you will get
        {dynamictasklist:Arthurs To-Do's}   
        
        h2.  Images
        
        Images can be embedded into Confluence pages from attached files or remote sources.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        !http://www.host.com/image.gif!
        or
        !attached-image.gif!  Inserts an image into the page.
        
        If a fully qualified URL is given the image will be displayed from the remote source, otherwise an attached image file is displayed.
        !spaceKey:pageTitle^image.gif!
        
        !/2007/05/23/My Blog Post^image.gif!  Inserts an image that is attached on another page or blog post.
        
        If no space key is defined, the current is space is used by default.
        !image.jpg|thumbnail!   
        
        Insert a thumbnail of the image into the page (only works with images that are attached to the page). Users can click on the thumbnail to see the full-sized image.
        
        Thumbnails must be enabled by the site administrator for this to work.
        !image.gif|align=right, vspace=4!   
        
        For any image, you can also specify attributes of the image tag as a comma separated list of name=value pairs like so.
        {gallery}
        
        {gallery:columns=3}
        
        {gallery:title=Some office photos, and a waterfall|columns=3}
        
        {gallery:title=Some office photos, without the waterfall|exclude=waterfall.jpg}
        
        {gallery:title=One office photo, and a waterfall|include=office1.jpg,waterfall.jpg}
        
        {gallery:title=Some office photos, and a waterfall|page=Gallery of Pictures}
        
        {gallery:title=Some office photos, and a waterfall|page=DOC:Gallery of Pictures}
        
        {gallery:title=Some office photos, and a waterfall|sort=name}
        
        {gallery:title=Some office photos, and a waterfall|sort=date|reverse=true}  
        
        Create a gallery of thumbnails of all images attached to a page. This will only work on pagesthat allow attachments, obviously.
        
        The title parameter allows you to supply a title for the gallery
        
        The columns parameter allows you to specify the number of columns in the gallery (by default, 4)
        
        The exclude parameter allows you to specify the name of attached images to ignore (i.e., they will not be included in the gallery). You can specify more than one picture, separated by commas. Example: exclude=my picture.png,my picture2.gif
        
        The include parameter allows you to specifically include one or more attached images. The gallery will show only those pictures. You can specify more than one picture, separated by commas. Example: include=my picture.png,my picture2.gif
        
        The page parameter allows you specify the title of one or more pages which contains the images you want displayed. If a page is in the same space as the page containing the macro, use the format page=My Page Name. To specify a page in a different space, use page=SPACEKEY:My Page Name, such as page=DOC:Gallery Macro. You can specify more than one page, separated by commas. Example: page=Image Gallery,STAFF:Group Photos
        
        If a page or attachment file name contains a comma, you can use it in the include, exclude, or page parameters by enclosing it in single or doublequotes. Example: include="this,that.jpg",theother.png
        
        The sort parameter allows you to control the order of the images. The options are name,comment, date, or size.
        
        The reverse parameter is used in conjunction with the sort parameter to reverse the order of the specified sort. Valid values are true and false.
        
        Previous versions of the Gallery macro had an additional slideshow parameter. This is no longer used in the latest version, and the slide show is always enabled. We have left the parameter here for compatibility with older versions of the macro.
        
        h2.  Tables
        
        Tables allow you to organise content in a rows and columns, with a header row if required.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        ||heading 1||heading 2||heading 3||
        |col A1|col A2|col A3|
        |col B1|col B2|col B3|  Makes a table. Use double bars for a table heading row. Note that each table-row has to be defined on a single line.
        
        The code given here produces a table that looks like:
        heading 1   heading 2   heading 3
        col A1  col A2  col A3
        col B1  col B2  col B3
        
        {column:width=50%}
        Text in this column.
        {column}  
        
        Defines a single column.
        
            width: - (optional) the width of the column. 
        
        Must be defined in a section macro.
        
        {section}
        
        {column:width=30%}
        Column one text goes here
        {column}
        
        {column:width=70%}
        Column two text goes here
        {column}
        
        {section}
        
        
        {section:border=true}
        ...
        {section}   
        
        If you want to use columns instead of tables, you can define them first by marking a {section}, and then placing any number of {column}s inside.
        
            border: - (optional) set to "true" to draw a border around the section and columns. 
        
        
        h2.  Advanced Formatting
        
        More advanced text formatting.
        
        || Notation || Comment |
        {code:title=Bar.java|borderStyle=solid}
        // Some comments here
        public String getFoo()
        {
            return foo;
        }
        {code}
        
        {code:xml}
        <test>
          <another tag="attribute"/>
        </test>
        {code}
          Makes a pre-formatted block of code with syntax highlighting. All the optional parameters of {panel} macro are valid for {code} too. The default language is Java but you can specify JavaScript, ActionScript, XML, HTML and SQL too.
        
        Example:
        Bar.java
        
        // Some comments here
        public String getFoo()
        {
          return foo;
        }
        
        
        <test>
            <another tag="attribute"/>
        </test>

            Display control parameters
                width - The width of the chart in pixels (default is '300')
                height - The height of the chart in pixels (default is '300')
                dataDisplay - Default is false to not display the rendered body of the macro (usually the data tables). When dataDisplay=true or dataDisplay=after, the data will be displayed after the chart. When dataDisplay=before, the data will be displayed before the chart.
                imageFormat - Default is png. Format of generated image. Valid formats are png and jpg. Other formats may be also be valid if installed on your server.
            Title and label customization parameters
                title - The title of the chart.
                subTitle - A subtitle for the chart using a smaller font.
                xLabel - The label to use for the x (domain) axis
                yLabel - The label to use for the y (range) axis
                legend - A legend will be displayed unless legend=false is specified.
            Data specification parameters - The data for the chart is taken from tables found when the macro body is rendered. These options control how this data is interpreted. By default, numeric and date values are interpreted according to the Confluence global default language (locale) formats. If conversion fails, other languages defined to Confluence will be tried. Additional conversion options can be specified using the parameters below.
                tables - Comma separated list of table ids and/or table numbers contained within the body of the macro that will be used as the data for the chart. Defaults to all first level tables. If data tables are embedded in other tables, then table selection will be required. This occurs when more complex formatting is done (for example using section and column macros).
                columns - Comma separated list of column labels and/or column titles and/or column numbers for tables used for chart data. This applies to all tables processed. Defaults to all columns. Columns are enumerated starting at 1. Column label is the text for the column in the header row. Column title is the (html) title attribute for the column in the header row.
                dataOrientation - The data tables will be interpreted as columns (horizontally) representing domain and x values unless 'dataOrientation=vertical'.
                timeSeries - If 'true', the x values in an XY plot will be treated as time series data and so will be converted according date formats.
                dateFormat - For time series data, the date format allows for additional customization of the conversion of data to date values. By default, the Confluence language defined date formats will be used. If a dateFormat is specified, it will be the first format used to interpret date values. Specify a format that matches the format of the time series data. See Date Format.
                timePeriod - Specify the time period for time series data. Default is 'Day'. This defines the granularity of how the data is interpreted. Valid values are: Day, Hour, Millisecond, Minute, Month, Quarter, Second, Week, Year.
                language - If provided, the language and country specification will be used to create additional number and date formats to be used for data conversion. This specification will be used before the default languages automatically used. Valid values are 2 character ISO 639-1 alpha-2 codes.
                country - Used in combination with the language parameter. Valid values are 2 character ISO 3166 codes.
                forgive - Default is true to try to convert numeric and date values that do not totally match any of the default or user specified formats. Specify forgive=false to enforce strict data format. Data format errors will cause the chart to not be produced.
            Color customization parameters - See Colors for how to specify colors.
                bgColor - Color (default is 'white') to use as the background of the chart.
                borderColor - Color of a border around the chart. Default is to not show a border.
                colors - Comma separated list of colors used to customize category, sections, and series colors.
            Axis customization parameters - Depending on the chart type, the range and domain axis may be customized. These values are automatically generated based on the data but can be overridden by specifying one or more more of these paramters.
                rangeAxisLowerBound - range axis lower bound
                rangeAxisUpperBound - range axis upper bound
                rangeAxisTickUnit - range axis units between axis tick marks
                rangeAxisLabelAngle - angle for the range axis label in degrees
                domainAxisLowerBound - domain axis lower bound. For a date axis, this value must be expressed in the date format specified by the dateFormat parameter. (Only used in XY Plots, standard charts will have no effect)
                domainAxisUpperBound - domain axis upper bound. For a date axis, this value must be expressed in the date format specified by the dateFormat parameter. (Only used in XY Plots, standard charts will have no effect)
                domainAxisTickUnit - domain axis units between axis tick marks. For a date axis, this value represents a count of the units specified in the timePeriod parameter. The time period unit can be overridden by specifying a trailing character: y for years, M for months, d for days, h for hours, m for minutes, s for seconds, u - milliseconds. (Only used in XY Plots, standard charts will have no effect)
                domainAxisLabelAngle - angle for the domain axis label in degrees. (Only used in XY Plots, standard charts will have no effect)
                categoryLabelPosition - allows axis label text position for categories to be customized
                    up45 - 45 degrees going upward
                    up90 - 90 degrees going upward
                    down45 - 45 degrees going downward
                    down90 - 90 degrees going downward
                dateTickMarkPosition - placement of the date tick mark
                    start (default) - tick mark is at the start of the date period
                    middle - tick mark is in the middle of the date period
                    end - tick mark is at the end of the date period
            Pie chart customization parameters
                pieSectionLabel - Format for how pie section labels are displayed. :
                    %0% is replaced by the pie section key.
                    %1% is replaced by the pie section numeric value.
                    %2% is replaced by the pie section percent value.
                Example 1: "%0% = %1%" would display something like "Independent = 20"
                Example 2: "%0% (%2%)" would display something like "Independent (20%)"
                pieSectionExplode - Comma separated list of pie keys that are to be shown exploded. Defaults to no exploded sections. Note: requires jFreeChart version 1.0.3 or higher.
            Attachment parameters - These are advanced options that can be used for chart versioning, automation enablement, and to improve performance. Use these options carefully! Normally, the chart image is regenerated each time the page is displayed. These options allow for the generated image to be saved as an attachment and have subsequent access re-use the attachment. This can be useful especially when combined with the cache macro to improve performance. Depending on the options chosen, chart images can be versioned for historical purposes.
                attachment - Chart image will be saved in a attachment.
                    ^attachment - chart.macro.param.attachment.attachment
                    page^attachment - The chart is saved as an attachment to the page name provided.
                    space:page^attachment - The chart is saved as an attachment to the page name provided in the space indicated.
                attachmentVersion - Defines the the versioning mechanism for saved charts.
                    new - (default) Creates new version of the attachment.
                    replace - Replaces all previous versions of the chart. To replace an existing attachment, the user must be authorized to remove attachments for the page specified.
                    keep - Only saves a new attachment if an existing export of the same name does not exist. An existing attachment will not be changed or updated. 
                attachmentComment - Comment used for a saved chart attachment.
                thumbnail - Default is false. If true, the chart image attachment will be shown as a thumbnail.
        
        Colors
        Colors can be specified by name or hex value. See Web-colors. The following are the valid color names that will automatically be converted.
        Color   Hexadecimal   Color   Hexadecimal   Color   Hexadecimal   Color   Hexadecimal
        black   #000000   silver  #c0c0c0   maroon  #800000   red   #ff0000
        navy  #000080   blue  #0000ff   purple  #800080   fuchsia   #ff00ff
        green   #008000   lime  #00ff00   olive   #808000   yellow  #ffff00
        teal  #008080   aqua  #00ffff   gray  #808080   white   #ffffff
        Date Format
        
        Copied from Java SimpleDateFormat specification.
        
        Date and time formats are specified by date and time pattern strings. Within date and time pattern strings, unquoted letters from 'A' to 'Z' and from 'a' to 'z' are interpreted as pattern letters representing the components of a date or time string. Text can be quoted using single quotes (') to avoid interpretation. "'" represents a single quote. All other characters are not interpreted; theyre simply copied into the output string during formatting or matched against the input string during parsing.
        
        The following pattern letters are defined (all other characters from 'A' to 'Z' and from 'a' to 'z' are reserved):
        Letter  Date or Time Component  Presentation  Examples
        G   Era designator  Text  AD
        y   Year  Year  1996; 96
        M   Month in year   Month   July; Jul; 07
        w   Week in year  Number  27
        W   Week in month   Number  2
        D   Day in year   Number  189
        d   Day in month  Number  10
        F   Day of week in month  Number  2
        E   Day in week   Text  Tuesday; Tue
        a   Am/pm marker  Text  PM
        H   Hour in day (0-23)  Number  0
        k   Hour in day (1-24)  Number  24
        K   Hour in am/pm (0-11)  Number  0
        h   Hour in am/pm (1-12)  Number  12
        m   Minute in hour  Number  30
        s   Second in minute  Number  55
        S   Millisecond   Number  978
        z   Time zone   General time zone   Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00
        Z   Time zone   RFC 822 time zone   -0800
        Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the exact presentation.
        
            Text: For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form is used if available. For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number of pattern letters.
            Number: For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount. For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless its needed to separate two adjacent fields.
            Year: For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a number.
        
            For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2, the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to Jan 11, 12 A.D.
        
            For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a SimpleDateFormat instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string "01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964. During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, will be parsed into the default century. Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit string, or a two digit string that isnt all digits (for example, "-1"), is interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.
            Month: If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is interpreted as text; otherwise, it is interpreted as a number.
            General time zone: Time zones are interpreted as text if they have names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the following syntax is used:
        
                 GMTOffsetTimeZone:
                         GMT Sign Hours : Minutes
        
                 Sign: one of
                         + -
                 Hours:
                         Digit
                         Digit Digit
        
                 Minutes:
                         Digit Digit
                 Digit: one of
                         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        
            Hours must be between 0 and 23, and Minutes must be between 00 and 59. The format is locale independent and digits must be taken from the Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard.
        
            For parsing, RFC 822 time zones are also accepted.
            RFC 822 time zone: For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used:
        
                 RFC822TimeZone:
                         Sign TwoDigitHours Minutes
                 TwoDigitHours:
                         Digit Digit
        
            TwoDigitHours must be between 00 and 23. Other definitions are as for general time zones.
        
            For parsing, general time zones are also accepted.

        !quicktime.mov!
        
        !spaceKey:pageTitle^attachment.mov!
        
        !quicktime.mov|width=300,height=400!
        
        !media.wmv|id=media!  Embeds an object in a page, taking in a comma-separated of properties.
        
        Default supported formats:
        
            Flash (.swf)
            Quicktime movies (.mov)
            Windows Media (.wma, .wmv)
            Real Media (.rm, .ram)
            MP3 files (.mp3)
        
        
        Other types of files can be used, but may require the specification of the "classid", "codebase" and "pluginspage" properties in order to be recognised by web browsers.
        
        Common properties are:
        
            width - the width of the media file
            height - the height of the media file
            id - the ID assigned to the embedded object
        
        
        Due to security issues, files located on remote servers are not permitted
        Styling
        By default, each embedded object is wrapped in a "div" tag. If you wish to style the div and its contents, override the "embeddedObject" CSS class. Specifying an ID as a property also allows you to style different embedded objects differently. CSS class names in the format "embeddedObject-ID" are used.

        The 'style' attribute can be any of 'h1' through 'h6'. If you specify a style, the top level of child pages will be displayed as headings of that level, with their children then displayed as lists below. A great way to throw together a quick contents page!
        
        You can view the children of a different page in the same space with {children:page=Another Page Title}.
        
        If you specify a page of '/', you will list all the pages in the space with no parent (i.e. the top-level pages), excluding the current page

            child
                first grandchild
            another child
        
        The 'sort' attribute is an optional attribute that allows you to configure how the children are sorted. Specify 'creation' to sort by content creation date, 'title' to sort alphabetically on title and 'modified' to sort of last modification date. Use the reverse attribute to optionally reverse the sorting.
        
        The 'first' attribute allows you to restrict the number of children displayed at the top level.

        Specifying the online value allows you to filter the user list by the user online status. Setting online=true will show only online users, whereas setting online=false will show only offline users.
        
        If you've configured this macro to display groups which are black listed by the administrator, you will get a warning panel at the top. The warning will be automatically displayed by default. To disable the warning, you can specify showWarning=false.

        Display the contents of a remote RSS feed within the page. Note: feeds are cached for 60 minutes before being retrieved again.
        
        The 'max' parameter can be used to limit the number of entries displayed.
        
        Example:
        Sample RSS Feed (RSS 2.0)
        (Feed description here...)
        My Item ( Dec 30, 2003 06:53)
        And part of the item content here...
        Another Item ( Dec 30, 2003 06:53)
        And part of the item content here...
        
        You can specify 'showTitlesOnly=true' to show only the RSS feed titles. This parameter defaults to false.
        
        You can specify 'titleBar=false' to hide the feeds titlebar. This parameter defaults to true.
        
        You can specify anonymous=false to download the target content over a trusted connection (Trusted Application). For instance {rss:url=http://example.com/path/to/target/location}. This parameter defaults to true.

        anonymous=true}   Imports and displays JIRA issue list as inline content for the page. You can easily customize the list and order of the columns being displayed, by specifying columns parameter.
        
        The url should be copied from the XML link of Jira's Issue Navigator. Refer to the JIRA Issues Macro documentation for further details.
        
        To specify a custom title (the text above the columns), you can specify the title parameter. By default this is JIRA Issues. A custom title can be specified by adding title=<My Custom Title> to the macros parameters.
        
        You can control how wide the {jiraissues} macro renders by specifying a width parameter. To specify the width in percentage, use width=XX%. To specify the width in pixels, use width=XXpx. If unspecified, the width will be 100%.
        
        Not specifying columns will lead into the default column list and order.
        
        Allowed columns are: key, summary, type, created, updated, assignee, reporter, priority, status, resolution.
        
        Specifying count=true will cause the macro to just print out how many issues were in the list, without printing the list.
        
        Using cache=off will force the macro to refresh its internal cache of Jira issues.
        
        Note: Certain filters may require a logged-in user in order to work. If a trust association has been established between Confluence and JIRA, user authentication details will be passed between the servers automatically. This functionality requires JIRA 3.12 or later. If a trust association is not available you can send the required login by appending:
        &os_username=yourJiraUsername&os_password=yourJiraPassword
        to the end of your jira issues URL.
        
        You can prevent the jiraissues macro from attempting to use a trusted application link by specifying anonymous=true. Issues will then be retrieved anonymously.

        SQL Macro
        
        Displays the result table(s) or values from an SQL statement(s), usually a query. Consider using the sql-query macro for simple queries. Data from single or multiple results sets are formatted usually as a table for display. Multiple SQL statements (semi-colon separated) can be specified within a single sql macro body (subject to support provided by specific databases). This macro supports common table capabilities with other table based macros (table-plus, csv, and excel).
        
        This macro may have restricted use for security reasons. See your administrator for details.
        
        Recursive use: Four identical macros sql, sql1, sql2, and sql3 are provided to enable recursive use of the macro.
        
            dataSource - Required parameter. Formerly known as the jndi parameter. For compatibility the jndi parameter will be still be used if the dataSource parameter is missing. Specify the datasource name defined in the application server. Do not use the standard prefix (java:comp/env/jdbc/) as it is added automatically if necessary. Specific values of this parameter may be restricted for security reasons. See your administrator for details.
            output - Determines how the output is formated:
                html - Data is output as a HTML table (default).
                wiki - Data is output as a Confluence wiki table. Use this option if you want data within the table to be formated by the Confluence wiki renderer.
            script - Location of sql statement. Default is the macro body only.
                #filename - Data is read from the file located in confluence home directory/script/filename. Subdirectories can be specified.
                global page template name - Data is read from a global page template.
                space:page template name - Data is read from a space template.
                ^attachment - Data is read from an attachment to the current page.
                page^attachment - Data is read from an attachment to the page name provided.
                space:page^attachment - Data is read from an attachment to the page name provided in the space indicated.
            heading - Number of rows to be considered heading rows (default is 1 row). Specify heading=false or heading=0 to not show any heading lines.
            border - The border width in pixels. Defaults to normal table border width.
            width - The table width in pixels. Default is 100%.
            rowOrientation - By default, data is oriented with rows appearing vertically (in rows) and columns in columns. Specify rowOrientation=horizontal to have rows appear horizontally (as columns) and columns appear as rows.
            columnLabel - By default, database column names are used as column labels. Specify columnLabel=true to have database column labels used for column labels. Note that most databases default the column label to be the column name when no explicit column label is provided. Fly-over text for a column label will be the column name when columnLabel=true. Fly-over text for a column label will be the database column label when columnLable=false or by default.
            limit - Sets the limit for the number of database rows that will be processed for display. The default is set by your administrator. Setting a larger value for this parameter may be restricted by your administrator. See your administrator for details.
            showUpdateCount - Default is false. Set to true to show a count of the number of rows updated.
            escape - When wiki output is requested (output=wiki), some special characters (like '|', '[', ']', '{', '}') in data may cause undesirable formatting of the table. Set escape=true to allow these special characters to be escaped so that it will not affect the formatting. The default is false so that data that has wiki markup will be handled correctly.
            convertNull - Default is true. Converts SQL NULL values to blank. Set to false to have NULL values show up as 'null'.
            table - Default is true. Set to false to not format the data in a table. This option can be used to run queries that produce single values that you want to include in text.
            noDataMessage - Default is blank. Text that is displayed when there are no rows in the result set. Use @default for a default message.
            noDataError - Default is false. Set to true to show an macro error when no data is returned from the query.
            expandArray - Default is true to have array fields expanded one entry per line for vertical row orientation.
            showSql - Default is false. Set to true to show a panel with the sql statement.
            macros - Default is false. Set to true to execute any macros so their value can be passed to the SQL query.
            SQL parameter markers - SQL supports parameter markers in statements - these are identified by ?'s. Parameters p1, p2, ... are substititued for the parameter markers. This can be used to parameterize complex scripts stored as attachments or files.
                p1 - first parameter marker
                p2 - second parameter marker
                ... - ...
            autoCommit - Advanced use only. Default is true. Set to false for sql that explicitly controls its own rollbacks and commits.
            transactionIsolation - Advanced use only. Set the transaction isolation level for the sql statements. The default will be used unless this parameter is set to a valid value from the following list:
                READ_COMMITTED (default) - any changes made inside a transaction are not visible outside it until the transaction is committed.
                READ_UNCOMMITTED - allows transactions to see uncommitted changes to the data.
                REPEATABLE_READ - rows that are read retain locks so that another transaction cannot change them when the transaction is not completed.
                SERIALIZABLE - Tables are locked for the transaction so that WHERE conditions cannot be changed by other transactions that add values to or remove values from a table
                NONE - Database does not support transactions
            disableAntiXss - Default is false. Set to true to stop encoding of html special characters found in table content. For security reasons, use of this parameter is restricted to authorized users. See your administrator for details.

        SQL Query Macro
        
        Displays a result table or values from an SQL select statement. The sql-query macro is recommended for better performance.
        
        This macro supports the same parameters as the sql macro, the primary difference is optimizations possible by the database when it knows that a select statement is expected. Some databases/drivers ignore this advice and perform the same as with the sql macro.
        
        This macro may have restricted use for security reasons. See your administrator for details.
        
        Recursive use: Four identical macros sql-query, sql-query1, sql-query2, and sql-query3 are provided to enable recursive use of the macro.
